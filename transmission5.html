            <p>...I know this is selfish. I know you’re doing something incredible out there. But I wake up every morning and you’re not next to me, and it’s like... the whole world’s a little off.
                The cats sleep on your side of the bed now. I think they miss your laugh.
                I’m not asking you to give up your dreams. I’m asking if those dreams could live in Texas too. If they could look like teaching at a community center by day and building your art collective by night.
                If they could look like porch lights, open skies, soft mornings, and a love that doesn’t have to stretch across states.
                I wanna build a life with you, not a fantasy. And I’ll follow you anywhere... but if you’re even considering coming back, please know I’d be there in a heartbeat.
                We could rescue cats and teach kids and make weird beautiful art together. Doesn’t that sound like proof of life?
                I love you. Come home.
                I’ll be waiting with open arms and a million ideas.</p>
