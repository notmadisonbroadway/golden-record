            <p>...Babe. Be for real.
                New York is expensive. Your skin is breaking out. You’re always stressed. For what? You’re working six jobs and still texting me for Venmo.
                You know what you could do with that talent and drive in Texas? Own the damn place. Start your theater company, do some influencer stuff, get brand deals. People eat that up here.
                And like... I miss you. It’s weird without you. Who else gonna hype me up when I get my nails done? Or tell me when I’m being dumb without making me cry?
                I get it—you love the drama (and I don’t just mean the theater). But your name would ring bells back here. People would support you, pay you.
                Plus, let’s not lie—you looked good as hell in cowboy boots.
                Come home. We’ll build a little empire together. </p>
