            <p>...Yo. So like, I know you’re out there doing plays and shit. That’s cool, I guess. But I just dropped 27 points last night, and nobody was there to see it.
                You used to come to my games, remember that? I keep lookin' at the bleachers thinkin' maybe you’ll walk in. You never do.
                Grandma's been sick again. She won’t say it but she misses you bad. We all do.
                NYU’s tight and all, but like... what are you even stayin’ out there for? You could do what you’re doin’ here. Be around us. Be around me.
                Anyway, just think about it. Season’s almost over. Would be cool if my big sibling actually got to watch me ball before I go D1.</p>
