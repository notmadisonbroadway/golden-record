            <p>...I’m not gon’ sugarcoat it. You knew this was comin’.
                You’re a grown adult now, and my wallet is closed. I didn’t bust my tail through law school and raise you on my own for you to turn around and think “the arts” is a damn excuse to keep playing in New York like life is a dress rehearsal. It ain’t.
                You wanna act? Produce? Direct? Fine. Do it in Texas. Dallas, Austin—hell, even Houston got production houses now. Why pay $2,000 for a closet apartment when your bedroom is still sittin’ right here with clean sheets?
                I’ve given you everything, and I’m proud. Don’t get it twisted. But my job is done. And if you keep tryin’ to play city-slicker, don’t come lookin’ for gas money when the rent’s due.
                You got a home here. You got people who love you. You got a mama who ain’t gonna watch you drown in debt because you’re too proud to come home.
                Don’t let that city chew you up and spit you out. Come back to where folks see you, not just your resume.</p>
