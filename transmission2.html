            <p>...Baby, I had a dream last night. You were standing on a hill overlooking water, and the moonlight was bouncing off it just right. I think it was the lake, our lake. And I felt peace.
                That’s my sign. The universe is telling me your spirit is ready to come home.
                Now I know New York is exciting—and I want you to chase your dreams—but not at the expense of your soul. The city don’t love you like we do. It’ll take and take until there’s nothing left.
                I don’t want you burning out trying to prove something to strangers. You don’t have to perform healing; you already carry it in your voice, your touch, your presence. You belong where people know your heart.
                Cancer’s been a teacher. Every ache, every scar—it’s made me see what matters. And baby, you matter. We don’t get many lifetimes to fix things. I want you near while I’m still here.
                Come home. I’ll help you find the stars again.</p>
